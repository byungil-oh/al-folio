I'm Byung-Il Oh! I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software at Sungkyunkwan University in Republic of Korea. I was supervised by Min-Suk Kang at <a href="">Visual Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a>.

I'm broadly interested in working memory and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I'm doing my mandatory military service in KATUSA from October 2018 to May 2020. See you soon!
