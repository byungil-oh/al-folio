Hello!

I was a undergraduate student at Sungkyunkwan University. I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software. I was supervised by Min-Suk Kang at Visual Cognitive Neuroscience Lab.

I'm broadly interested in working memory and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I'm doing my mandatory military service in KATUSA from October 2018 to May 2020. See you soon!
