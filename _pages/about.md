Welcome! I'm Byung-Il Oh, currently performing my mandatory military service in KATUSA from October 2018 to May 2020.

Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. I had worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab">VCLA</a> under the supervision of Min-Suk Kang.

I'm interested in working memory and artficial intellegence. Especially, I studied ensemble representations and visual working memory by using electroencephalogram and behavioral tasks. I also love to learn computational algorithms. 

For further information, please see my curriculum vitae! Thank you.
