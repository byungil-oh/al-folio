I'm Byung-Il Oh! I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software at Sungkyunkwan University in Republic of Korea. I worked at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab">VCLA</a> under the supervision of Min-Suk Kang.

I'm broadly interested in working memory and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I'm doing my mandatory military service in KATUSA from October 2018 to May 2020. See you soon!
