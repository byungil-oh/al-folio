Welcome! My name's Byung-Il Oh (오병일).
I'm a software engineer at Samsung Electronics from September 2020.

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student majoring in psychology and computer engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea. During my Bachelor's degree, I studied working memory and published a paper in Nature Communications [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13592-6">link</a>].

For details, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
