Welcome! I'm Byung-Il Oh.

I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea. I had also worked as a research assistant under the supervision of Min-Suk Kang for three and half years. Particularly, I studied ensemble representations and visual working memory in human EEG and behavioral data with machine learning and Bayesian modeling.
