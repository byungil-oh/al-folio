Welcome! My name's Byung-Il Oh (오병일). I will work for Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. as a software engineer from September 2020.

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student majoring in psychology and software at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea. During my Bachelor's degree, I mostly studied working memory and published a paper in Nature Communications.

For details, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
