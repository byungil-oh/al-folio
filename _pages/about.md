Welcome! My name is Byung-Il Oh, and currently I'm performing my mandatory military service in South Korea.

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student majoring in psychology and software at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). During my Bachelor's degree, I mostly studied visual working memory and ensemble representations in human EEG with machine learning and Bayesian modeling. Now I'm broadly interested in computational approaches to human cognition.

For details, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
