Welcome! I'm Byung-Il Oh, currently performing my mandatory military service in KATUSA from October 2018 to May 2020.

Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in psychology and convergence software at <a href="https://www.skku.edu/">Sungkyunkwan University</a> in the Republic of Korea. I had also worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab">VCNL</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R6KDuS8AAAAJ">Min-Suk Kang</a> for three and half years. Particularly, I studied ensemble representations and visual working memory in human EEG and behavioral data with machine learning and Bayesian modeling.

For further information, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
