Welcome! My name is Byung-Il Oh, and currently I'm performing my mandatory military service in South Korea. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student majoring in psychology and software at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). I'm broadly interested in computational approaches to human psychology.

For details, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
