Welcome! My name is Byung-Il Oh (오병일), and currently I'm performing my mandatory military service in South Korea.

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student majoring in psychology and software at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea. During my Bachelor's degree, I mostly studied visual working memory and ensemble representations with machine learning and Bayesian modeling. Now I'm broadly interested in computational approaches to human cognition.

For details, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">curriculum vitae</a>. Thank you!
